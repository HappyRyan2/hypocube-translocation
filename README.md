# hypocube-translocation
This is an abstract puzzle game that involves translocating (moving) hypocubes (squares). The game is played in a grid of tiles, each containing an extender that can push an object in a certain direction.

Instead of the traditional linear level format, each challenge is placed inside of a 'level pack'.
